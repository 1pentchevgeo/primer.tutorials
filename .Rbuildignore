# Not sure how to find all files regardless of the directory in which
# they live. But the below seems to work.

^.*tutorial\.html$
^.*tutorial_files$

# See the .gitignore on 03-data-A for discussion. This is a hack! Must
# be a way to exclude any file in this directory which is not tutorial.Rmd.
# Indeed, that would solve the above lines as well. The "this" is a total
# hack. For some reason, the first suffix in the list is not matched, but
# all others are. So, we need a not-used suffix at the start.

# inst/tutorials/03-data-A/*\.{this|csv|txt|xlsx|rds|json|html}

# Arrg! But even this hack does not seem to work. It causes (how?) all the 
# files in inst/www to not be included in the built package. But those
# files are very necessary!
