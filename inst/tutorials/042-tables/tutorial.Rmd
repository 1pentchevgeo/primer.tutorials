## Tables

### 

The `knitr` package gives the tools to embed tables into our website. There are also other packages which can render tables with different features. 

### Exercise 1 

Start a pipe with the `mtcars` data set. Arrange this by `mpg` in ascending order. 

```{r tables-and-images-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r tables-and-images-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
mtcars %>% 
  arrange(mpg)
```

### 

Notice that the first column, the name of the cars, does not have a column name. This is because it is not technically a column, but a **row name**. This is not the case with most of the data sets we work with (only data frames, not tibbles support it). 

### Exercise 2

In the other R Studio session, open index.Rmd. Create a new code chunk, name it table-1, and copy and paste your code from exercise 1 within it. Print the table and knit the document. 

### 

In the Terminal, run `tail index.Rmd`. Copy and paste the result below. 

```{r tables-and-images-2}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    options = list(nrows = 3))
```

### 

This table looks similar to a console output. It could look a lot better. 

### Exercise 3

Let's add a table using the function `kable()`. It is part of the `knitr` package.  First, save the code above to an object called `table`. 

### 

In the setup chunk, load the library `knitr`. Save `index.Rmd`

### 

In the Terminal, run `grep library index.Rmd`. Copy and paste the result here.


```{r tables-and-images-3}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    options = list(nrows = 3))
```

### 

This should return all the lines in which you load packages, including the most recent, `knitr`. 

### Exercise 4

Create a new code chunk named `table-2`.

### 

In that chunk run `kable(table)`. Knit the .Rmd. 

### 

In the Terminal, run `tail index.Rmd`. 

```{r tables-and-images-4}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    options = list(nrows = 3))
```

### 

`kable` produces a compact and well-formatted tibble. 

### Exercise 5

Let's add a table using the function `paged_table()`. It is part of the `rmarkdown`. 

### 

In the setup chunk, load the library `rmarkdown`. Save `index.Rmd`

### 

In the Terminal, run `grep library index.Rmd`. Copy and paste the result here.


```{r tables-and-images-5}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    options = list(nrows = 3))
```

### 

This should return all the lines in which you load packages, including the most recent, `rmarkdown`. 

### 

### Exercise 6

Create a new code chunk named `table-3`.

### 

In that chunk run `paged_table(table)`. Knit the .Rmd. 

### 

In the Terminal, run `tail index.Rmd`. 

```{r tables-and-images-6}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    options = list(nrows = 3))
```

### 

`paged_table` produces a table similar to the R Markdown table output. Its chief advantage is that it allows for the table to have pages and take up less space. 

### Exercise 7

The table you just cannot display all of its columns in one window and so has a navigation arrow for the columns. There are two reasons for this: first, default maximum of columns printed with `paged_tables` is 10; second, the window in which Distill renders the table is too small. 

### 

Within your `paged_table` function, add `options(cols.print = 12)` as the second argument. Knit the .Rmd. 

### 

In the Terminal, run `grep options index.Rmd`. Copy and paste the result below. 

```{r tables-and-images-7}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    options = list(nrows = 3))
```

### 

This tibble is even worse. YThe navigation arrow is still present and you need a horizantal scroller on the bottom to see it. 

### Exercise 8

To increase the width of the window in which Distill renders the graph, we can add options the setup chunk. After the chunk name add a comma and then the code `layout = "l-body-outset"`. 

### 

In the Terminal run the command `grep "r " index.Rmd`. This should return a list of all your code chunk headers, including the most recent one. Copy and paste the result below.

```{r tables-and-images-8}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    options = list(nrows = 3))
```

### 

Now you should have a table which displays all twelve columns in one window. 

### 

For an even wider window for rendering objects in Distill, use `layout = "l-page"`. The layout command can be used for any object that Distill renders, including plots. 

### 

The command `datatable()` in the package `DT` allows for a paged table with even more user interaction. It allows the user to sort the table by variables and to search through the table. Here is an image of `mtcars` using the `DT` package function:

```{r}
include_graphics("images/datatable.png")
```

### Exercise 9

Let's add a table using the function `gt` in te package `gt`. It is similar to `kable()` in look, but allows for more customization, like a title, subtitle, and caption. 

### 

In the setup chunk, load the library `gt`. Save `index.Rmd`

### 

In the Terminal, run `grep library index.Rmd`. Copy and paste the result here.


```{r tables-and-images-9}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    options = list(nrows = 3))
```

### 

This should return all the lines in which you load packages, including the most recent, `gt`. 

### 

### Exercise 10

Create a new code chunk named `table-4`.

### 

In that chunk run `gt(table)`. Knit the .Rmd. 

### 

In the Terminal, run `tail index.Rmd`. 

```{r tables-and-images-10}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    options = list(nrows = 3))
```

### 

Without further customization, this table looks similar to the tibble we made using `kable()`. 

### Exercise 11

Note that this table has not printed `rownames`. 

### 

Within `gt`, set the argument `rownames_to_stub` to `TRUE`. Knit the .Rmd

### 

In the Terminal, run `grep TRUE index.Rmd`. 

```{r tables-and-images-11}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    options = list(nrows = 3))
```

### 

There are a few other methods for handling rownames in `gt`. Most likely, you will not have to deal with data with rownnames during your final project. 

### Exercise 12

Use a pipe to add the function `tab_header()`. Set the `title` argument to "1974 Automobiles". Set the `subtitle` argument to "The least fuel efficient cars are the heaviest". Knit the .Rmd

### 

In the Terminal  run `tail index.Rmd`. Copy and paste the result below. 

```{r tables-and-images-12}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    options = list(nrows = 3))
```

### Exercise 13

Let's bold the title. To do so, still within the quotation marks, surround the text 1974 Authomobiles with two asterisks. Then enclose the entire string in the function `md()`, like so, title = `md("**1974 Automobiles**")`. Knit the .Rmd

```{r tables-and-images-13}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    options = list(nrows = 3))
```

### 

`md` stands for markdown and allows the same formatting syntax as used in markdown to be used in the string. You can also italicize using this function and only one asterisk on each side.  

### Exercise 14

Continue your pipe with `tab_source_note()`. The function `tab_source_note()` allows you to add a caption to the graph. Make the argument of the function "Source: Henderson and Velleman (1981)". Knit the .Rmd

### 

In the Terminal, run `grep Henderson index.Rmd`. Copy and paste the result below. This should return both the code for this caption as well as the code for the caption on your plot. 

```{r tables-and-images-14}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    options = list(nrows = 3))
```

### Exercise 15

Continue your pipe with `tab_spanner()`. The function `tab_spanner()` allows you to add a heading to a group of variables. Set the first argument `label` equal to "Variable Group 1". Set the second argument `columns` equal to a vector of the first five columns, `c(mpg, cyl, disp, hp, drat)`. Knit the .Rmd. 

### 

In the Terminal, run `tail index.Rmd`. Copy and paste the result below. 

```{r tables-and-images-15}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    options = list(nrows = 3))
```

### 

## gt ( )

`gt` has many more features including footnotes and even fill color based on data values.
In this section you will learn to create a table using the `gt( )` function.

### Exercise 1

###

First, let's start off by loading in the `gt` library
```{r gt-ex-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r gt-ex-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
library(...)
```

### Exercise 2

###

Now run `?gt` to get more information about the `gt( )` function. This will give you an idea of what you need to make best use of this function.

```{r gt-ex-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gt-ex-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
library(...)
```

### 

Now let's make a table! the table we will make will end up looking like this:
```{r}
x <- trains %>%
  select(gender, income, att_end) %>%
  slice(1:5)
gt_obj1 <- x %>% 
  gt() %>%
    tab_header(title = md("**Enos Data Observations**"), 
               subtitle = "Gender, Income, and End Attitude from the Trains Data")%>%
    cols_label(gender = "Gender",
               income = "Income", 
               att_end = "End Attitude") %>% 
    tab_source_note(md("Source: Ryan Enos, *Causal Effect of Intergroup 
                       Contact on Exclusionary Attitudes*")) %>%
    fmt_currency(columns = c(income), 
                 decimals = 0) 
gt_obj1
```

###

The data set that will be used to make this table is the trains data set which can be found in **primer.data**.

### Exercise 3
The first step is to load in the dataset.


```{r gt-ex-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r gt-ex-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
trains
```

###
This shows us the first 10 rows of the data set. At this point we do not know what any of the data means.

### Exercise 4
We should learn what the data set contains. We can do this by running `?trains`.

```{r gt-ex-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r gt-ex-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
?trains
```

###

From the description we learn that the data shows individuals' attitudes toward immigration-related policies, both before and after an experiment which randomly exposed a treated group to Spanish-speakers on a Boston commuter train platform.

###

`?trains` isn't the only way to get more information about a data set. Some other functions are `glimpse(trains)`, `trains`, `summary(trains)`, `skim(trains)`, `View(trains)` and `?trains`. These commands have been ordered from least info to most info.

### Exercise 5
To start creating the table, first we need our data

```{r gt-ex-5, exercise = TRUE}
# AJ: Eventually need to add exercises that guide student to get to this code
trains %>%
  select(gender, income, att_end) %>%
  slice(1:5)
```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gt-ex-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}

```

### Exercise 6
Now that we have the data we will be including in the table, continue your pipe with gt( ).
```{r gt-ex-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gt-ex-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  ...(...,...,...) %>% 
  ...(...:...) %>% 
  gt()
```
###

Your output should look like this:

```{r}
trains %>% 
  select(gender, income, att_end) %>%
  slice(1:5) %>% 
  gt()
```

###

We now have a functional table. Let's make it look like the table we are aiming to make.

A reminder on how that table looks:

```{r}
gt_obj1
```

### Exercise 7
You can add a title and subtitle to the table by using `tab_header()`. Add a title and subtitle to your table.
```{r gt-ex-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gt-ex-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(title = "...",
             subtitle = "...")
```

###

What you have at this point should look like this:
```{r}
trains %>%
    select(gender, income, att_end) %>%
slice(1:5) %>% 
    gt() %>%
    tab_header(title = "Enos Data Observations", 
               subtitle = "Gender, Income, and End Attitude from the Trains Data")
```

###

Notice how the title is not bold like it is in the table we want to recreate.

### Exercise 8
By default, titles and other text can not be formatted. If you want formatting, you must wrap the character string in a call to md()

```{r gt-ex-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gt-ex-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
the code to bold text in md() is adding `**` to both ends of the string
```

```{r gt-ex-8-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(title = md("**...**"),
             subtitle = "...")
```

```{r download-answers, child = "../../child_documents/download_answers.Rmd"}
```
