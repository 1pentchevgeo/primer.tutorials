## Flipping a coin 


Now,Let's create the following *empirical distribution* of flipping a fair coin. Recall, that empirical distribution is based on data therefore we need to simulated our data, that is "flipping the coin" by ourself.

```{r}
emp_p <- tibble(results = rbinom(n = 100, size = 1, prob = 0.5)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = results)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),
                 binwidth = 0.5,
                 color = "white") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 1),
                     labels = c("Heads", "Tails")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels =
                      scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Mathematical Probability Distribution",
       subtitle = "Expectations for flipping a fair coin",
       x = "Outcome\nResult of Coin Flip",
       y = "Probability") +
  theme_classic()

emp_p
```

### Exercise 1

Let's simulate a fair coin, i.e. $p_h = p_t = 0.5$. To do so, use the function `rbinom()`. Recall `rbinom()` is used to draw from a binomial distribution (when there are only two possible outcomes). Within `rbinom()`, set `n` to 100, `size` to 1, and `prob` to .5.  Again we set the probability to 50% because we drawn our data from the population of "fair coin", keep in mind of this concept, because it will shows up throughout this chapter and later chapters.

```{r fac-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r fac-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
rbinom(... , ..., ....)
```

```{r fac-1-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
rbinom(n = ..., size = ..., prob = ....)
```

Family functions include `dbinom()`,`pbinom()``qbinom()`. In general, dbinom gives the density, pbinom gives the distribution function, qbinom gives the quantile function and rbinom generates random deviates.

<!-- From https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/Binomial.html -->


### Exercise 2

Create a `tibble()` with one variable `results` . Have `results` take on the values of the `rbinom()` code in the previous exercise.  

```{r fac-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r fac-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(... = rbinom(..., ..., ...))
```





### Exercise 3

Pipe your results to `ggplot()`. Map `results` to the x-axis. Also add the layer `geom_histogram()`. 

```{r fac-3, exercise = TRUE}

```


<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r fac-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(...) + 
  geom_histogram()
```

### Exercise 4

Within `geom_histogram()`, use `after_stat()` . Inside `after_stat()`, use `aes()` with the argument `y = count/sum(count)` to put percents on the y-axis.

```{r fac-4, exercise = TRUE}

```


<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r fac-4-hint, eval = FALSE}
... +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(...) 
```

### Exercise 5

Also set `binwidth` to .5 and `color` to "white" within `geom_histrogram()`.

```{r fac-5, exercise = TRUE}

```


<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

### Exercies 6

Now use `scale_x_continuous()` so the x-axis has `breaks` at 0 and 1. Set the `labels` for the breaks as "Heads" and "Tails", respectively. 


```{r fac-6, exercise = TRUE}

```


<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r fac-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
Use the c() function for specifying the breaks and labels.
```

```{r fac-6-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(..., ...),
                     labels = c(..., ...))
```

### Exercise 7

Now use `scale_y_continuous()` to put the x-axis in percent format. Within `scale_y_continuous()`, set `labels` to `scales::percent_format()`. Within `percent_format()` set `accuracy` to 1.

```{r fac-7, exercise = TRUE}

```


<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r fac-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(...))
```

### Exercise 8

Finally, use `labs()` to add the appropriate title, subtitle, and axis labels. Also add the layer `theme_classic()`.

```{r face-8, exercise = TRUE}

```


<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

Reminder: Your plot should look similar to the the one below. **Note**: the height of the bars will vary because our `rbinom()` statements generate different proportions every time! 

```{r}
emp_p
```

## Rolling Two Dice

Let's create the following *empirical distribution* for rolling two dice.

```{r}
set.seed(1)

emp_dist_dice <- tibble(ID = 1:100) %>% 
  mutate(die_1 = map_dbl(ID, ~ sample(c(1:6), size = 1))) %>% 
  mutate(die_2 = map_dbl(ID, ~ sample(c(1:6), size = 1))) %>% 
  mutate(sum = die_1 + die_2) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = sum)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))), 
                   binwidth = 1, 
                   color = "white") +
    labs(title = "Empirical Probability Distribution",
         subtitle = "Sum from rolling two dice, replicated one hundred times",
         x = "Outcome\nSum of Two Die",
         y = "Probability") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2, 12, 1), labels = 2:12) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = 
                         scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
    theme_classic()

emp_dist_dice
```


### Exercise 1

Create a `tibble()` with variable `ID`, and the we make an list of value from 1 to 100 for the variable `ID`.

```{r rd-1, exercise = TRUE}

```



```{r rd-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(ID = ... : ...)
```

```{r rd-1-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
tibble(ID = 1: 100)
```

`tibble()` function provides us a framework to generate our data, this function will be used throughout this tutorial.

### Exercise 2
Nice! Now let's pipe down the tibble we create in the last exercise, let's use th `map_dbl` function to create the results for an random dice rolling experiment. recalled the` map() and map_*()` functions, within it it will includes two argument one is the data source, which in this case is `ID`. and the formula we want to use to create the dice result is the `sample()` function, and use the argument `size` within the `sample()` function to only pick one out of the six faces of a standard dice.

```{r rd-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r rd-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...%>%
map_dbl(..., ~...)
```

```{r rd-2-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
...%>%
map_dbl(ID, ~sample(c(...:...), size = 1))
```



### Exercise 3
Nice! Now let's pipe down the above and use the `mutate()` function to assign the `map_dbl` functions we above to an value called "die_1".


```{r rd-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r rd-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...%>%
mutate(... =map_dbl(ID, ~sample(c(...:...), size = 1)))
```

```{r rd-3-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
...%>%
mutate(die_1 = map_dbl(ID, ~ sample(c(1:6), size = 1))) %>% 
```


### Exercise 4
Now copy and paste the results from above, and do the exact same thing again but instead now named to value to `die_2`, because we need the results for two dices.


```{r rd-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r rd-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...%>%
mutate(... =map_dbl(ID, ~sample(c(...:...), size = 1)))
```

```{r rd-4-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
...%>%
mutate(die_2 = map_dbl(ID, ~ sample(c(1:6), size = 1))) %>% 
```




### Exercise 5
Copy and paste the results from above, use the `mutate()` function once again, name the value of the sum of `die_1` and `die_2` to "sum"


```{r rd-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r rd-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...%>%
mutate(sum = die_1 + die_2)
```


### Exercise 6
Copy and paste the results from above, now use `ggplot()` to graph the Empirical Distribution, set `x = sum` within `aes()`, and then add a layer of `geom_histogram()`


```{r rd-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r rd-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...%>%
ggplot(aes())+
  geom_histogram()
```



### Exercise 7

Within `geom_histogram()`, use `after_stat()` . Inside `after_stat()`, use `aes()` with the argument `y = count/sum(count)` to put percents on the y-axis.

```{r rd-7, exercise = TRUE}

```


<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r rd-7-hint, eval = FALSE}
... +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(...)))
```

### Exercise 8

Also set `binwidth` to .5 and `color` to "white" within `geom_histrogram()`.

```{r rd-8, exercise = TRUE}

```


<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>


```{r rd-8-hint, eval = FALSE}
... +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))), 
                   binwidth = 1, 
                   color = "white") 
```



### Exercies 9

Now use `scale_x_continuous()` so the x-axis has `breaks` to the sequence between 2 and 12 common difference is 1 using `seq()`. Set the `labels` for the breaks as from 2 to 12.


```{r rd-9, exercise = TRUE}

```


<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r rd-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(...,..., ...), labels = ...:...) 
```

```{r rd-9-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2, 12, 1), labels = 2:12) 
```

### Exercise 10

Now use `scale_y_continuous()` to put the x-axis in percent format. Within `scale_y_continuous()`, set `labels` to `scales::percent_format()`. Within `percent_format()` set `accuracy` to 1.

```{r rd-10, exercise = TRUE}

```


<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r rd-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(...))
```

### Exercise 11

Finally, use `labs()` to add the appropriate title, subtitle, and axis labels. Also add the layer `theme_classic()`.

```{r rd-11, exercise = TRUE}

```


<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

Reminder: Your plot should look similar to the the one below. 

```{r}
emp_dist_dice
```


## Height

Let's create the following *empirical distribution* about the "height of the next adult men you'll meet" using the data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).

```{r}
emp_height <- nhanes %>%
  filter(gender == "Male", age >= 18) %>%
  select(height)%>%
  drop_na() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = height)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))), 
                 binwidth = 1, 
                 color = "white")+
  labs(title = "Empiracal Probability Distribution",
       subtitle = "Height for male by NHANES",
       x = "Height",
       y = "Probability",caption = "Source:NHANES") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels =
                      scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  theme_classic()
emp_height
```


### Exercise 1

glimpse the package `nhanes`

```{r h-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r h-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
glimpse(nhanes)
```

Note that there is all sorts of column in this data set, but the two that we actually care about is gender and height.
 
### Exercise 2

Start a new pipe with `nhanes`, use `filter()` to filter out the rows where gender is equal to "Male", and age is greater or equal to 18

```{r h-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r h-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
nhanes %>%
  filter(gender == ..., age >= ...) 
```

```{r h-2-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
nhanes %>%
  filter(gender == "Male", age >= 18) 
```

### Exercise 3
Copy and paste the code above, then use `select()` to pick out "height" column which is what we want.Then use `drop_na()` to drop the rows that contains NA which we don't want. 


```{r h-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r h-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...%>%
  select(height)%>%
  drop_na()
```

### Exercise 4

Copy and paste the code above, use `ggplot()` and `geom_histogram()` to graph out the distribution, set x equal to "height" within `ggplot()`.


```{r h-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r h-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=...)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

### Exercise 5

Copy and paste the code above, then within `geom_histogram()`, use `after_stat()` . Inside `after_stat()`, use `aes()` with the argument `y = count/sum(count)` to put percents on the y-axis.


```{r h-5, exercise = TRUE}

```


<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r h-5-hint, eval = FALSE}
... +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(...) 
```

### Exercise 6

Also set `binwidth` to .5 and `color` to "white" within `geom_histrogram()`.

```{r h-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r h-6-hint, eval = FALSE}
... +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))), 
                   binwidth = 1, 
                   color = "white") 
```

### Exercise 7

Now use `scale_y_continuous()` to put the x-axis in percent format. Within `scale_y_continuous()`, set `labels` to `scales::percent_format()`. Within `percent_format()` set `accuracy` to 1.

```{r h-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r h-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(...))
```

### Exercise 8

Finally, use `labs()` to add the appropriate title, subtitle, and axis labels. Also add the layer `theme_classic()`.

```{r h-8, exercise = TRUE}

```


<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

Reminder: Your plot should look exatly like this one because we used the exact same data from nhanes.
```{r}
emp_height
```


## Three Models 
###

Let's create the following *joint distribution* of the number of white marbles in a bag and the number of white marbles pulled out in the sample.

```{r}
joint_p <- joint_dist %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = in_sample, y = in_bag)) +
    geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5) +
    labs(title = "Black and White Marbles",
         subtitle = "More white marbles in bag mean more white marbles selected",
         x = "White Marbles Selected",
         y = "White Marbles in the Bag") +
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0, 1, 2)) +
  theme_classic()

joint_p
```

### Exercise 1

Create a `tibble()` with one variable `in_bag`. Have `in_bag` take on the values of `rep()`. Within `rep()` use the arguments 0, 1, and 2. 

```{r tm-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r tm-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(in_bag = rep(c(..., ..., ...)))
```

Great. We now have generated the number of white marbles that exist in our bag. 

### Exercise 2

Great. Let's have our code run 1000 times. Add the argument 1000 to `rep()`

```{r tm-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>


```{r tm-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
 tibble(in_bag = rep(c(0, 1, 2), ...))
```

### Exercise 3

Pipe your results to `mutate()` to create the variable `in_sample`. Set `in_sample` to the function `map_int()`. The first argument to `map_int()` should be `in_bag`. The second argument should be an `rbinom()` where `n` is set to 1, `size` is set to 3, and `p` is set to `./2`.

```{r tm-3, exercise = TRUE}

```


<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r tm-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
 ... %>% 
  mutate(in_sample = map_int(..., ~ rbinom(..., 
                                           ..., 
                                           ...)))
```

### Exercise 4

Copy/paste your code from above. Assign in to the object `joint_dist`.

```{r tm-4, exercise = TRUE}

```


<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r tm-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
 joint_dist <- ...
```

### Exercise 5

Pipe your `joint_dist` to `ggplot()`. Map `in_sample` to the x-axis and `in_bag` to the y-axis. Also add the layer `geom_jitter()`. 

```{r tm-5, exercise = TRUE}

```


<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>


```{r tm-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
joint_dist %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = ..., y = ...)) +
    geom_jitter()
```

### Exercise 6

Set `alpha` to .5 within `geom_jitter()`. 

```{r tm-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>


```{r tm-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
    geom_jitter(...)
```

### Exercise 7

Now use `scale_y_continuous()` to break the y-axis into three values. Within `scale_y_continuous()`, set `breaks` to 0, 1, and 2.

```{r tm-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r tm-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(..., ..., ...)
```

Why do we do this? Each value on the y-axis represents a different version or belief about the world.

### Exercise 8

Finally, use `labs()` to add the appropriate title, subtitle, and axis labels. Also add the layer `theme_classic()`.

```{r tm-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

Reminder: This is what your plot should look like.

```{r}
joint_p
```


```{r tm-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}

```

### 

Awesome. We can now see the number of simulations in each "bucket." Take note that this distribution is unnormalized.

###

Let's create the following *unnormalized conditional distribution*. This is essentially a slice of the joint distribution we previously created. 

```{r}
unnorm_p <- joint_dist %>% 
  filter(in_sample == 3) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(in_bag)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.25, color = "white") +
    labs(title = "Unnormalized Conditional Distribution",
         subtitle = "Number of white marbles in bag given that three were selected in the sample",
         x = "Number of White Marbles in the Bag",
         y = "Count") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 2)) +
    theme_classic()

unnorm_p
```

### Exercise 9

`filter()` `joint_dist` for where `in_sample` is equal to 3.

```{r tm-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r tm-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
joint_dist %>% 
  filter(in_sample == ...)
```

### Exercise 10

Pipe your code above to `ggplot()`. Map `in_bag` to the x-axis. Also add the layer `geom_histogram()`.

```{r tm-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r tm-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  ggplot(aes(...)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

### Exercise 11 

Set `binwidth` to .25 and `color` to "white" within `geom_histogram()`.

```{r tm-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r tm-11-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  geom_histogram(..., ...)
```

### Exercise 12

Now use `scale_x_continuous()`. Set `breaks` to `seq()` that contains the values 1 and 2.

```{r tm-13, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r tm-13-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  scale_x_continuous(... = seq(..., ...))
```

### Exercise 13

Finally, use `labs()` to add the appropriate title, subtitle, and axis labels. Also add the layer `theme_classic()`.

```{r tm-14, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

Reminder: This is what your plot should look like.

```{r}
unnorm_p
```

### 

Let's create the following *normalized conditional distribution*. In other words, we are normalizing the graph we just created.

```{r}
norm_p <- joint_dist %>% 
  filter(in_sample == 3) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(in_bag)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))), 
                   binwidth = 0.25, 
                   color = "white") +
    labs(title = "Posterior Probability Distribution",
         subtitle = "Number of white marbles in bag given that three were selected in the sample",
         x = "Number of White Marbles in the Bag",
         y = "Probability") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1, 2)) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = 
                         scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
    theme_classic()

norm_p
```

### Exercise 14

We begin our code the same way we began our code for the *unnormalized conditional distribution*. We have provided the code for you below. To begin, add the `after_stat()` argument to `geom_histogram()`. Within `after_stat()`, use `aes()` with the argument `y = count/sum(count)` to put percents on the y-axis.


```{r tm-15, exercise = TRUE}
 joint_dist %>% 
  filter(in_sample == 3) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(in_bag)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.25, color = "white")
```

```{r tm-15-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.25, color = "white", ...)
```

### Exercies 15

Now use `scale_x_continuous()` so the x-axis has `breaks` at 1 and 2.

```{r tm-16, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r tm-16-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
Use the c() function for specifying the breaks and labels.
```

```{r tm-16-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(..., ...))
```

### Exercise 16

Now use `scale_y_continuous()` to put the y-axis in percent format. Within `scale_y_continuous()`, set `labels` to `scales::percent_format()`. Within `percent_format()` set `accuracy` to 1.

```{r tm-17, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r tm-17-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(...))
```

### Exercise 17

Finally, use `labs()` to add the appropriate title, subtitle, and axis labels. Also add the layer `theme_classic()`.

```{r tm-18, exercise = TRUE}

```

## N Models 
###

Let's create the following *empirical distribution* for possible simulations for $\rho_h$. In other words, we will create a joint distribution of models which might be true and of data which our experiment might generate. 

```{r}
x <- tibble(p = rep(seq(0, 1, 0.1), 1000)) %>%
  mutate(heads = map_int(p, ~ rbinom(n = 1, size = 20, p = .)))

emp_p <- x %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = p, x = heads)) +
    geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1) +
    labs(title = "Empirical Distribution of Number of Heads",
         subtitle = expression(paste("Based on simulations with various values of ", rho[h])),
         x = "Number of Heads out of 20 Tosses",
         y = expression(rho[h])) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.1)) +
  theme_classic()

emp_p
```

### Exercise 1

Use `tibble()` with one variable `p` set to the function `rep()`. Within `rep()` use the argument `seq()` that takes on the values 0, 1, and .1.

```{r nm-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r nm-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(...= rep(c(..., ..., ...)))
```

### Exercise 2

Great. Let's have our code run 1000 times. Add the argument 1000 to `rep()`

```{r nm-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nm-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
 tibble(p = rep(c(0, 1, .1), ...))
```

### Exercise 3

Pipe your code to the function `mutate()` to create the variable `heads`. Set `heads` to the function `map_int()`. The first argument to `map_int()` should be `p`. The second argument should be an `rbinom()` where `n` is set to 1, `size` is set to 20, and `p` is set to `.`.

```{r nm-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nm-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
 ... %>% 
  mutate(p = map_int(..., ~ rbinom(...,
                                   ..., 
                                   ...)))
```

### Exercise 4

Copy/paste your code above. Assign your code to an object named `x`.

```{r nm-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nm-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
x <- ...
```

### Exercise 5

Pipe `x` to `ggplot()`. Map `heads` to the x-axis and `p` to the y-axis. Also add the layer `geom_jitter()`. 

```{r nm-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nm-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
x %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = ..., y = ...)) +
    geom_jitter()
```

### Exercise 6

Set `alpha` to .1 within `geom_jitter()`. 

```{r nm-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nm-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  geom_jitter(...)
```

### Exercise 7

Now use `scale_y_continuous()`. Set `breaks` to the function `seq()` that contains the values 0, 1, and .1.

```{r nm-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nm-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(..., ..., ...)
```

### Exercise 8

Finally, use `labs()` to add the appropriate title, subtitle, and axis labels. Also add the layer `theme_classic()`.

```{r nm-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

Reminder: This is what your plot should look like.

```{r}
emp_p
```

###

Let's create the following *unnormalized conditional distribution*. This is essentially a slice of the joint distribution we previously created. 

```{r}
unnorm_p <- x %>% 
  filter(heads == 8) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(p)) +
    geom_bar() +
    labs(title = expression(paste("Values of ", rho[h], " Associated with 8 Heads")),
         x = expression(paste("Assumed value of ", rho[h], " in simulation")),
         y = "Count") +
  theme_classic()

unnorm_p
```

### Exercise 9

`filter()` `x` for where `heads` is equal to 8.

```{r nm-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r nm-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
x %>% 
  filter(heads == ...)
```

### Exercise 10

Pipe your code above to `ggplot()`. Map `p` to the x-axis.  Also add the layer `geom_bar()`.

```{r nm-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nm-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  ggplot(aes(...)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

### Exercise 11

Finally, use `labs()` to add the title "Values of P(h) with 8 Heads". Then label your x-axis "Assumed value of P(h) in simulation". Also add the layer `theme_classic()`.

```{r nm-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

Reminder: This is what your plot should look like.

```{r}
unnorm_p
```


###

Let's create the following *normalized conditional distribution*. In other words, we are normalizing the graph we just created.

```{r}
norm_p <- x %>% 
  filter(heads == 8) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = p)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),
                   bins = 50) + 
    labs(title = expression(paste("Posterior Probability Distribution of ", rho[h])),
         x = expression(paste("Possible values for ", rho[h])),
         y = "Probability") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0.2, 0.7, by = 0.1)) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = 
                        scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  theme_classic()

norm_p

```

### Exercise 12

We begin our code the same way we began our code for the *unnormalized conditional distribution*. We have provided the code for you below. To begin, add the layer `geom_histogram()` and set `bins` to 50.


```{r nm-12, exercise = TRUE}
x %>% 
  filter(heads == 8) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = p))
```

```{r nm-12-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  geom_histogram(...)
```

### Exercise 13

Within `geom_histogram()`, use `after_stat()` . Inside `after_stat()`, use `aes()` with the argument `y = count/sum(count)` to put percents on the y-axis.

```{r nm-13, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nm-13-hint-1, eval = FALSE}

```

### Exercise 14

Now use `scale_x_continuous()`. Set `breaks` to `seq()` that contains the values 0.2 and 0.7. Also set `by` to 0.1 within `seq()`.

```{r nm-14, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nm-14-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  scale_x_continuous(... = seq(..., ..., ...))
```

### Exercise 15

Now use `scale_y_continuous()` to put the y-axis in percent format. Within `scale_y_continuous()`, set `labels` to `scales::percent_format()`. Within `percent_format()` set `accuracy` to 1.

```{r nm-15, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>


```{r nm-15-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(...))
```



### Exercise 16

Finally, use `labs()` to add the title "Posterior Probability Distribution of P(h)". Then label your x-axis "Possibility values for P(h)" and y-axis "Probability". Also add the layer `theme_classic()`.


```{r nm-16, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>
