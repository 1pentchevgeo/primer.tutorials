<!-- What happens when our assumptions are violated? Of course, we have not really talked yet about assumptions in a rigorous way, but maybe this is where we do? Consider the assignment mechanism and the sampling mechanism. Both are examples of the broader category of missing data mechanisms. Why is our Preceptor Table missing items, both whole rows and, sometimes, just some columns? What assumptions do we need to make to fill in those missing values. -->

<!-- This sets the stage for all the discussions about unrepresentativeness which follow in later chapters. -->

<!-- Perfect doctor example? Shows why the recommended approach in Chapter 4 only works with random assignment. -->

<!-- CHECKLIST BEFORE STARTING: -->
<!-- * Load necessary libraries for tutorial in the first code chunk -->
<!-- * Edit yaml at the START OF THIS FILE -->
<!-- * Review: https://ppbds.github.io/primer.tutorials/articles/instructions.html -->
