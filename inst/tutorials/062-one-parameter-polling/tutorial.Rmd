<!-- Need to teach students how to use the standard error. Maybe in tutorial. Emphasize the equivalence of 17% best guess wit 1% SE is the same thing as 17% best guess with a 95% confidence interval of 11% to 23%.   -->

<!-- CHECKLIST BEFORE STARTING: -->
<!-- * Load necessary libraries for tutorial in the first code chunk -->

## Study

###

## Posterior

###

Let's create the posterior distribution for the proportion $\rho$ of U.S 18-29 year olds who approved of President Obama in 2009,  


<!-- RS: In two different rooms of the same size, one filled with all American adults, and one filled with just 18-29 year olds, what is the probability that the rooms will have a different number of people who approve of Obama? -->
