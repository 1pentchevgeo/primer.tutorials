TO-DO Items for Tutorials

testing PR 


* New tutorial: 02-gathering-data It includes its own data directory in which there are a bunch of csv files with just a handful of lines. Each csv file has an "issue," which can be fixed with intelligent use of read_csv. skip to get rid of top rows; no variable names; using col_types; parsing dates and other stuff; et cetera. Start with 10 questions. We can add more. Also include some Excel files. I will provide those. Maybe a Google sheet as well?


* spacing ggplot(aes(x = rtg))


* geom_col exists in a couple of places, but I removed it from Chapter 1. Do we still need it? If not, just replace it as best you can in those plots. Use Find in Files to find these.





To discuss:

In many settings, it is natural for a tools question to have three parts. First, run a line of code that reports on the value of something. Example:

rstudioapi::readRStudioPreference(name = "load_workspace", default = "Code failed.")

This will return the defaul value. (I am not what that is.)

Second, change the setting. This generally want return anything.

rstudioapi::writeRStudioPreference(name = "load_workspace", value = FALSE)

See how the first was "read" and the second was "write"? Then, the third and final step is to confirm that the change worked by re-running the first code again.

rstudioapi::readRStudioPreference(name = "load_workspace", default = "Code failed.")

And finish with a sentence that tells the student to notice that the value has changed and that it is no right. (Of course, we "monitor" that by making them copy/paste this last command and its return from the Console into the tutorial.)

* More on weird variable names.

* What to do with PDF and tinytex?

* Explaining several times the concept of random draws. Make a nice graphic? Include in book and in tutorials?

* mention iter = 10000

* Revisit making tables nice.

To Explore:

* Can we ask for name and e-mail in one question? Or one screen?

* Get rid of red "Ok"" box in answer to text questions.

* Get rid of color red when replying to text questions.

* Put the number of exercises in the group header so that students know how long? Or maybe put in in the exercise header in exercise 5, 10 and so on.

* Can we do web-scraping in a tutorial?

* Can we get shortcut keys to work in tutorials, especialy CMD-shift-m?

* Can question_text provide the user with more empty lines to fill?

* Can we give students a search box in the tutorial so that they can find answers to questions they have already done?

* There is a lot of redundent text in tutorials: Write your name, submit, et cetera. Any way to avoid copying/pasting that each time? Maybe we need a "make tutorial" script which would take a raw tutorial and then add that material to it. Perhaps a template? But then we can't (?) go back and make a change in our other 20 tutorials.

* Can we show "answers" to a Tutorial after students have submitted it? How? Maybe all we need is a script which pulls out the code for all the major examples and puts it in a single RMD which we could knit and distribute? If we had a standard scheme for naming the R code chunks in which these are created, pulling them out would be easy. Indeed, creating this file could be part of the test process!

* How can we automate the testing of hints? Or maybe make all hints eval=FALSE? Maybe have our testing process check that all hints have eval=FALSE?

* How test for exercise chunks with no lines, which causes a weird error?

* Interesting discussion and some plausible claims: http://laderast.github.io/2020/09/15/getting-learnr-tutorials-to-run-on-mybinder-org/. Claims that "the .Rmd file containing the tutorial should be named the same as the directory it is in." But why? Also: "I personally like to have individual data/ folders in each tutorial, as it makes making them a little easier to deploy." Interesting! Would be nice to make each tutorial more self-contained, perhaps.

* Fix ames nonsense. Best to replace it in the tutorial with a poli-sci example and then use that example in the chapter. (Save this until we decide whether or not to get rid of tidymodels all-together.)
